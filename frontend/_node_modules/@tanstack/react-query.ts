/**
 * This file exists to resolve TypeScript type conflicts between CommonJS and ES modules.
 * 
 * The issue:
 * - @tanstack/react-query package provides both .d.ts (CommonJS) and .d.mts (ES Module) type definitions
 * - When importing directly from the package, TypeScript may get confused about which type definitions to use
 * - This can lead to type conflicts and errors, especially in projects mixing CommonJS and ES modules
 * 
 * The solution:
 * - This re-export file explicitly uses the CommonJS type definitions via @deno-types annotation
 * - It then re-exports everything from the package
 * - By importing through this file instead of directly from @tanstack/react-query,
 *   we ensure consistent type resolution using the CommonJS typings
