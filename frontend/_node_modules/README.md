# _node_modules Directory

## Purpose
This directory provides a unified location for managing and overriding npm package exports in our project.

## Usage
The `_node_modules` directory is used to:
- Override or customize how npm packages are exported
- Resolve compatibility issues between module systems
- Add custom type definitions or module augmentations
- Provide consistent package access through the `+/` import alias

## Example
A common use case is resolving TypeScript type conflicts between CommonJS and ES modules, as seen in the `@tanstack/react-query.ts` file.

## Benefits
- Centralized management of package customizations
- Clean separation from application code
- Consistent handling of package modifications
- Better control over external dependencies

## Implementation
Packages that need special handling have their exports defined here, while the rest are accessed through regular node_modules.
